<!-- Explanation

    Reducer Function:
        The reducer function is a pure function that determines how the state should change in response to an action.
        It uses a switch statement to handle different action types and return a new state.

    useReducer() Hook:
        useReducer(reducer, initialState) initializes the state and provides a dispatch function to send actions to the reducer.
        state contains the current state managed by the reducer.
        dispatch is used to send actions to the reducer which then updates the state.

    Actions:
        Actions are plain objects with a type property. They can also include additional data in a payload if needed.
        In the example, the action type is used by the reducer to determine how to update the state.Explanation
